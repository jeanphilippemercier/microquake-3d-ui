3D visualization with vtk.js

## Building the Web client

This assume you have node and npm installed. If you need to install them using `nvm` is usually a better path.
Although this step is only required to build it. If already built, this can be skipped.

```
$ cd client
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

## Running the client in development mode

```
$ cd client 
$ npm run serve
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.
